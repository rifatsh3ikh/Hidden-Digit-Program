# Hidden Digit Program

A simple and fun number guessing game with a modern graphical user interface built using Python and the CustomTkinter library.

## About The Project
This application, titled "Hidden Digit Finder," is a classic "Guess the Number" game. The program generates a secret number between 1 and 100, and the player's objective is to guess it in the fewest attempts possible. The interface provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low, and it keeps track of the number of attempts.

## Features
- **Dynamic Feedback**: Tells you if your guess is "Too High" or "Too Low".
- **Attempt Counter**: Tracks how many guesses you've made.
- **Sleek UI**: A clean and modern dark-mode interface built with CustomTkinter.
- **Restart Functionality**: Easily start a new game at any time with the "Restart Game" button.
- **Input Validation**: Ensures that only numerical inputs are processed.
